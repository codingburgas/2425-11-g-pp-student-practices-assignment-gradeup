# Recommendation Engine Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the recommendation engine to fix the issue with consistent 24% match scores regardless of user input.

## Problem
The original implementation had several issues:
- Hardcoded confidence values of 24%
- Same recommendations regardless of user survey answers
- Limited variety in program options
- Generic match reasons not related to user input

## Improvements

### 1. Bulgarian University Data
- Updated demo program list with actual Bulgarian universities
- Added multiple Computer Science programs from different universities
- Included a diverse set of programs across multiple disciplines
- Added location-specific data for better matching

### 2. Interest-Based Weighting
- Implemented extraction of math_interest, science_interest, art_interest, and sports_interest values
- Created mapping between interest categories and program keywords
- Scale interest level (1-10) to proportional score contribution

### 3. Multiple Interest Factor Support
- Combined different interest categories for comprehensive matching
- Weighted keywords based on relevance to interest categories
- Created a comprehensive interest profile for each user

### 4. Percentage-Based Confidence Scoring
- Converted raw scores to percentage values (0-100%)
- Added minor variance for more realistic recommendations
- Ensured minimum confidence threshold to avoid identical matches

### 5. Context-Aware Match Reasons
- Generated reasons based on high-interest areas
- Included program-specific qualifiers
- Provided personalized explanations for recommendations
