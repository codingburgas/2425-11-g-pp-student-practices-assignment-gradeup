Enhanced Recommendation Scoring System

This file documents the improvements made to the recommendation scoring system:

1. Interest-based weighting:
   - Uses math_interest, science_interest, art_interest, and sports_interest
   - Maps these interests to program keywords for better matching
   - Scales interest level (1-10) to proportional score contribution

2. Multiple interest factor support:
   - Combines different interest categories
   - Weights keywords based on relevance to interest categories
   - Creates a comprehensive interest profile for each user

3. Percentage-based confidence scoring:
   - Converts raw scores to percentage values (0-100%)
   - Adds minor variance for more realistic recommendations
   - Ensures minimum confidence threshold to avoid identical matches

4. Context-aware match reasons:
   - Generates reasons based on high-interest areas
   - Includes program-specific qualifiers
   - Provides personalized explanations for recommendations
